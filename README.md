## Travel AI 

This application was built as part of my summer internship with DXOS. The intention of this application was to be eventually integrated into the chat-rooms built using DXOS's Kai framework. 

This application was built primarily in React and uses a GPT-powered travel bot to generate trip suggestions and search for flights. 

The model used is GPT-3.5, and the Kiwi Flight API is used to dynamically suggest flights based on user inputs.
